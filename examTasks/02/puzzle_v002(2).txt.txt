After a couple of days our rations were running low and we were starting to feel the effects of hunger. We were going through our inventory list and it looks like only a single SNEAKERS bar is left. Everyone wanted it. So in order to determine who will get it a tournament will be held. The game that was chosen was Rock Paper Scissors. Your best friend from work is allergic to nuts, but the good news is that he is a mathematical genius and came up with a strategy (your puzzle input) that will guarantee your win, without making it too obvious. The first column is what your opponent is going to play: (A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors.) While he was about to explain the second column his team lead called him to gather some wood for the fire. Your guess is that the second column must be what you should plain in response (X for Rock, Y for Paper and Z for Scissors). The winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score.

The winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your score for each round. The score is calculated as follows: (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper and 3 for Scissors) + (0 if you lost, 3 if it is a draw and 6 if you won).

Task calculate the score you would get if you follow the strategy that your friend created.
